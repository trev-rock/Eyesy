# Eyesy
This repository is dedicated to the Critter and Guitari Eyesy device 

After purchasing an Eyesy I quickly realized that there is a lack of content on the internet about it. I will be making tutorials of how to use it and the nuances that come along with the programming side of it.

It seems that there is a lot of crossover between the ETC and Eyesy
