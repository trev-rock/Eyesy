# Eyesy
This repository is dedicated to the Critter and Guitari Eyesy device 

After purchasing an Eyesy I quickly realized that there is a lack of content on the internet about it. I will be making tutorials of how to use it and the nuances that come along with the programming side of it. There is a lot of crossover between how the ETC and Eyesy work and run Python Files


**eyesy-test.py** 

This file is a modified version of Kirk's file etc-test.py in order to make it compartible with the Eyesy
In order to properly use it in your terminal type in "**python3 eyesy-test.py module_name.py**" where "module_name.py" is the module you want to test
If using a patch that is in a folder, insert the eyesy-test.py file into the folder of the file you want to test.


Controls: 
  - You can simulate turning the Eyesy's knobs by pressing 1-5 and the up/down arrow keys
  - Pressing 'x' simulates playing loud audio
  - Pressing 'c' simulates playing soft audio
